# Airbnb Clone

## Context 
The goal of this project is to focus on Frontend development, ie :
- fidelity with official website [airbnb.com](https://airbnb.com)
- UX / UI (responsive, clarity, animations)

Pages to implement :
- Home (filters, grid with defaults houses results)
- House detail page
- Displaying results is basically the same template as "home" (no need to display on a map)

We don't want to spend much time on backend. That's why we'll just implement a basic API that is only able to provide data. 
Which means: 
- no authentification system
- only GET requests (no POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.)

First idea is to use a JSON file containing data, then use GraphQL on Frontend-side to make queries.
